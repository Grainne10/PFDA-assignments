## Overview

I work at [TE Connectivity] (https://www.te.com/usa-en/home.html)

I am a student at the [Atlantic Technological University] (https://www.atu.ie/), Galway, studying the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics on a part-time basis over 2 years.

This repository contains weekly assignments and tasks completed as part of the Programming for Data Analytics module. Each notebook demonstrates various Python programming techniques, data analysis approaches, and problem-solving strategies. It describes the weekly tasks and explains how I solved them and what research I did . I include reference resources that I used to come to the solution.


## Tasks 

### Task 1: Repository Setup

#### Task Description:
Create a repository for this module, and upload a link to where you will put your handups.  

#### Task Solution:
For this module, I created three repositories following the course guidelines:  

- `PFDA-assignments`: Folder/Repository for course assignments  
- `PFDA-mywork/`: Folder/Repository for additional work and exercises  
- `PFDA-project/`: Folder/Repository for module project work  
 
 The objectives of this task were to familiarize students with GitHub repository creation, learn basic repository and folder management and understand the process of pushing work to GitHub.

### Task 2: Weather 

#### Task Description:
Read in a CSV file and create a jupyter notebook assignment2-weather.ipynb that has a nice plot of the temperature over time  

#### Task Solution:

The task requires the user to import, export and manipulate data. It shows how to handle time data, how to clean and preprocess data and also creates an informative visualisation. I imported the necessary libraries (pandas and matplotlib) and read the CSV file into a DataFrame. I created an excel file to view the data first and check if there was any missing data. The file weatherreadings1.csv contains time and temperature data, which I cleaned and prepare for visualization. I created a stem plot whicd displayed the temperature (Â°C) on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. It showed the fluctuations in temperature over time, with annotations highlighting the highest and lowest temperatures.








Week 2 Weather
Task 1
Commit something to your repository. For this task I have set up my folders, I have started the readme document for my assignments and I am committing these to the repository.
Task 2 
Create a jupyter notebook that reads in a CSV file and create a plot of the temperature data over time.
I will add my research notes to this



## Prerequisites
